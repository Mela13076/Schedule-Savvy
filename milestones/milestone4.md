## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were very organized this week because we were able to utilize GitHub issues more effectively and converse much more on Slack. We were also able to communicate the problems we were facing with our tasks in order to solve them.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We found difficulty in trying to implement some of the features (though we resolved it with clear communication). We were also tied up with personal and academic obligations which made it harder to focus on completing assigned tasks.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We were able to finish about 3/4th of our planned tasks this week, which is a good result overall. To improve on it, we plan to start our sprints earlier in the week so that we will have more time to discuss any issues we might me facing.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The user stories that we would say are "at risk" are those that have to do with user authentication -- as we plan to implement this in a rudimentary way that doesn't necessarily guarantee the secure storage of user data. Our relationships between tables might also need to change depending on whether they fit what we want to display to the user.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will need additional support in implementing authentication features (that don't necessarily have to be through GitHub but maybe through directly storing user credentials in the database). Since this is a stretch feature, however, our priority now is to finish the foundational features, some of which we will need assistance in figuring out. For example: how to implement self-referrential tables to make "subtasks" relationships of tasks to other tasks.
