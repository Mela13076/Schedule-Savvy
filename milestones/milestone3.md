## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, we worked collaboratively, established a project board, gained proficiency in creating issues, assigning them to team members, and, most importantly, honed our skills in utilizing GitHub for more effective team collaboration.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Initially, we faced challenges with setting up milestones. However, we overcame this hurdle by creating a new repository with identical files, which ultimately facilitated the implementation of milestones more smoothly.

### 3. Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We successfully established the backend, configured the database tables, and developed the API for our frontend integration. Additionally, we've initiated frontend development. In the upcoming week, our primary focus will be on frontend work, with potential refinements to the backend if necessary.

### 4. Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

One potentially challenging aspect to consider is the implementation of accessibility features. While it may not be mandatory, prioritizing some form of accessibility is essential to ensure inclusivity for individuals who rely on these features.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

In the forthcoming units as we progress with our final project, the guidance and expertise of our TF and Web103 instructor will be invaluable. Many aspects of our project involve unfamiliar territory, and having someone with their knowledge and experience will greatly assist us in navigating and tackling these challenges effectively.
